        <h2> Nice to meet you I'm Veshona.</h2>
  
   <div class="boxy">
  <p> I am a designer, illustrator, and web developer. I've been a techie for as long as I could remember. When I was 11 years old I discovered my love for art and motion pictures, I loved it so much that I had to do it myself. When I got to High school my love for art and tech soon became one when I learned coding and graphic design. For 7 years I've learned animation, and then how to mash it in along with design and web development to get a masterpiece! Still I'm always learning and growing and looking for ways to improve my skills.   </p>

  <p> When my face is not in a screen for work, it will most likely be in a screen for fun. I enjoy drawing a lot, so sometimes I may be drawing or animating just for fun, also I am a nerd so I like to play video games. Don't worry I get fresh air, one of my favorite sports is roller skating.</p>
